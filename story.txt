Our story begins on a rainy thursday afternoon where Peter wakes up to his morning alarm. Peter does his morning routine before leaving his studio apartment. 
Peter begins his hour long commute to the office. He has little to no idea that his life will change forever.
	As Peter walked to the office, his shoes randomly lit on fire. Peter leaped into the nearby river in order to put out his shoe fire. Unfortunately, this river was notorious for its many robot crocodiles. To avoid the robocrocs, Peter hopped into a luxury yacht on the river which was being driven by none other than batman.
        Batman then proceeded to offer Peter the chance to be Robin. Peter felt that he could not live up to this role, as he was already Superman's sidekick. However, after much persuasion, Peter agreed to become the next Robin. Peter would then spend the next four weeks training vigorously to get abs and qualify as a superhero. 	
	After Peter got trained, they entered the biggest mission of the century. Dragians, a new Alien species from Jupiter, had invaded Gotham City. Peter, the newbie, was afraid deeply and wanted to leave, but Batman told him that he would get one of his bat throwers and thus he stayed. With fear still deep inside him, he used is intelligent brain and his strength to evacuate the Dragians out.
